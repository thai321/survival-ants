# Survival Ants

### Simulation Demo
![simulation](docs/simulation.gif)


- Survival Ants is an evolutionary simulation where steering agents disguised as ants eat food and avoid rotten eggs (poison). The concept is based on [Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/) by Craig Reynolds, and its implementation is through genetic algorithms and artificial intelligence.

## Feature & Implementation
- `Ants`:
  - `Attributes`:
    - Each ant searches for food `streeing behaviors` using their antennas `perception`.
    - The ant `seeks` the closest food in their food range `perception`.
    - The ant has a health level, which they need to maintain in order to survive
    - The ant has a `current velocity(vector)` and their `acceleration` (vector), and it's limited by the `maximum speed` (number).
    - The ant has a `desired` velocity:
      - desired velocity = food location - the ant's location
    - The `steering behaviors` determines how they rotate and approach the food, and it's limited by the `maximum force` (number):
      - `steering` = `desired` - `current velocity`
  - Death:
    - The ant will die if they eat rotten eggs
    - The ant will die if their health reaches 0
    - The ant turns into food for other ants if they die
  - `Clone`:
    - The ant has its own `DNA` which is the unit that determines their `food attraction` levels
    - There is 0.1% chance that the ant will `clone` themselves. The `new clones` `DNA` is slightly different than the original.

- `Food` and `Rotten Eggs`:
  - `Food` is randomly generated by a 10% chance of every draw frame
  - `Rotten eggs` are randomly generated by a 1% chance of every draw frame
  - The `ants` health levels increase after eating food
  - The `ants` will die if they hit the poison.



- User interaction / Mouse functionality
  - `User` has the ability to drop `food` and feed the `ants` by clicking on the `food` and pressing or dragging on the image.

- `Debug Mode`:
  - The triangle represents the ant.
  - The triangle color represents the ant health between green and red
    - green means the ant is healthy
    - red means the ant is in low health, and may die soon
  - The `green circle` is the ant's food range `perception`.
  - The `green line` is the ant's desired `magnitute`.

- Auto-Restart:
  - The app is automatically restarted if there are no more ants.
